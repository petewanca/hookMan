A full stack demo of user auth utilizing MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). React Context with Hooks for state management and Passport for user authorization. Validating input with Hapi/Joi and authenticating with json web tokens. Meant to be used as plug&play solution with any full stack app that needs user auth.

## Future additions

-   Add option to extend user session with refresh token
-   Convert auth logic to run on secondary server
